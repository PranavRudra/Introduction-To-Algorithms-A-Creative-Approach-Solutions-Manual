  ### Correctness proof
  
  We use loop invariants. 
  
  Let $P(k)$ be the proposition that after the $k$-th iteration of the loop, none of the nodes in the range `[head, p]` contain `val`. 
  
  ### Base case
  $P(0)$ is vacuously true. `p = dummy_head` (which is before `head`) before the loop starts, so there are no nodes in the range `[head, p]`
  
  ### Inductive step
  Observe that after any iteration of the loop, one of two things can happen.
  1. `p` doesn't move 
     - In this case, $P(k) \implies P(k + 1)$ is clearly true since nothing has changed
     - That is, it's still true that none of the nodes in the range `[head, p]` contain `val`. 
  2. `p` points further ahead in the list
     - When this happens, `p` skips over all the nodes in the range `[p + 1, q)` and then points to `q`
     - As a result, the nodes in the range `[head, new p]` $==$ the nodes in the range `[head, old p]` + `q`
     - By the induction hypothesis, we know that none of the nodes in the range `[head, old p]` contain `val`
     - Further, since `p` is only updated like this when `q.val != val`, we know that `q` doesn't contain `val` either.
     - Thus, $P(k) \implies P(k + 1)$ because after the latest iteration, none of the nodes in the range `[head, (new) p]` contain `val`
  
  ### Termination requirement
  The loop ends when `q is None`. Since `q = head` before the loop and moves forward `1` node each iteration, this will happen after exactly $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the size of the list.
