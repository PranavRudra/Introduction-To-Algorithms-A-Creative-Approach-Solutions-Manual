## Exercise 4.3 (page 86)

<details>
  <summary>Problem statement</summary>
  
  Convert the simple recursive search procedure for binary search trees to a nonrecursive procedure.
  - You can solve it [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/). Make sure implement it iteratively.

  ### Implementation
  You can find my implementation [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/916051436/)
  
  ### Time complexity (worst case)
  $\mathcal{O}(n)$
  - The question doesn't say that the BST is balanced.
  - Hence, the "tree" could be a linked list (i.e. a "degenerate" tree where each node has a left child but a null right child)
  - Moreover, we could be inserting a number that is smaller than all existing values in our degenerate tree
  - In this case, we'd end up visiting all nodes in the tree because we hit the `if val < curr.val` branch in every loop iteration
  
  ### Space complexity (worst case)
  $\mathcal{O}(1)$
