  ### Induction hypothesis
  Say you're on index $k$ of the list and you also know the rightmost index $j < k$ such that the node at $j$ doesn't contain `val`.
  
  Let's call the pointer at $k$ `curr` and the one at $j$ `prev`
      
  ### Inductive step
  We've got two possibilities.
                                                                                   
  1. `curr.val == val`
     - We can just `curr = curr.next`
     - There's no need to update the `prev` pointer
       - The rightmost index $j < k + 1$ such that node at $j$ doesn't contain `val` is still $j$.            
  2. `curr.val != val`
     - We can:
        1. `prev.next = curr`
        2. `prev = curr`                                                                           
        3. `curr = curr.next`
     - The rightmost index $j < k + 1$ such that the node at $j$ doesn't contain `val` is now $j = k$
       - This is exactly where our `prev` pointer is now sitting
  
  ### Base case
  Just make sure that:
   - `curr` points to the head of the list
   - `prev` points to some `None` value (or a dummy node before the head)
  
  This maintains the hypothesis (vacuously), since there is no rightmost index $j < 0$ such that the node at $j$ doesn't contain `val`.
