## Exercise 4.2 (page 86)

<details>
  <summary>Problem statement</summary>
  
  Write a program to reverse the direction of a given linked list. In other words, the pointers should all point backwards.
  - You can solve it [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/). Try to implement it both iteratively and recursively.

  <summary>Problem solution (iterative)</summary>
  
  You can find my implementation [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/916046200/)
  
  ### Correctness proof
  Omitted, but here's the loop invariant to use.
  
  Let $P(k)$ be the proposition that after the $k$-th iteration, the new list stores the first $k$ nodes of the original list in reversed order.
